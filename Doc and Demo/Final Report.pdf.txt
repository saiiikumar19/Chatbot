1. Problem Statement
Many college students struggle to find structured guidance and mental support during placements and academic stress. A chatbot can bridge this gap.

Proposed a chatbot using Watson Assistant connected to a front-end (React/Vite).

Solution Architecture includes:

Frontend: React-based chatbot UI

Backend: Watson Assistant for NLP + Firebase for storage

Database: Firebase Firestore or local JSON-based data

Ideation: June 1–3

Design: June 4–6

Setup: June 7–9

Development: June 10–13

Testing: June 14–15

Final Output: June 16–17

5. Testing Phase
Conducted functional and performance testing.

Average response time: 1.2 seconds.

All test cases passed successfully.
