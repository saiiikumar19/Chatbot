**Proposed Solution â€“ Citizen AI Chatbot**

The proposed solution is a smart AI-powered chatbot that allows citizens to report public issues (like road damage, garbage, streetlight failure) quickly and easily through natural conversation.

The chatbot will be embedded into a government website or mobile app, where users can describe their problem in plain language. The bot will then ask follow-up questions (like location, image, etc.), generate a complaint ID, and store all the information in a real-time database.

Citizens can later check the status of their complaint using their ID. The bot also allows feedback submission once the issue is resolved.

**Key Features:**
- Conversational interface (supports English/local language)
- Complaint submission with tracking
- Auto-generated complaint ID
- Admin dashboard to view/manage issues
- Real-time database integration (Firebase)
- Feedback system to improve services

This solution is simple, scalable, and can reduce workload on call centers while improving citizen satisfaction.
