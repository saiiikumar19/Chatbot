Empathy Map – Citizen Facing Government Services
1. Think & Feel
"I don't understand how to apply for schemes or services."

"Will I be eligible for this government benefit?"

"This process feels too complex and frustrating."

"I wish someone could explain things in my language."

2. See
Complicated websites with too much text.

No clear instructions or help in local languages.

Long queues at government offices.

Confusing forms without guidance.

3. Hear
"You need to know someone inside to get this done."

"Just go to the office, online won’t help."

"There’s no one to answer calls or emails."

"It’s not worth applying; they never respond."

4. Say & Do
Complain to neighbors or family about the process.

Post about the issue on social media or WhatsApp groups.

Visit government offices repeatedly.

Try multiple portals and still give up midway.
