We brainstormed multiple ideas to help citizens access public services more easily.

Some ideas were: a government FAQ chatbot, SMS-based help system, and local language helpline.

After evaluating feasibility and impact, we finalized a multilingual Citizen AI Chatbot using IBM Watson.

This chatbot will answer public queries on schemes, services, and issues.
